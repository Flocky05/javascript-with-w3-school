// jQuery vs JavaScript
// jQuery was created in 2006 by John Resig. It was designed to handle Browser Incompatibilities and to simplify HTML DOM Manipulation, Event Handling, Animations, and Ajax.

// syntax of jQuary
const myElement = $("#202");

// but in js we use
myElement = document.getElementById("id01");
