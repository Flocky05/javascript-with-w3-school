// boolean value means true or false value return
// let a = 10;
// let b = 19;
// let x = Booleanl(a > b);
// console.log(x);
// if answer is not right that time its show false and if answer is right then output will be true.

// if any time the result /value is zero(0) then output will be false if any answer is -0 then it show output is false.

// == use as here we just check the value, in js all type of value are string so here show right and and will be true

let m = 6;
let n = "6";
console.log(m == n);

// but if we use === in that equation that time show false couse of here cheack two type value and data type. but here data type is not same so here output will be false

console.log(m === n);
