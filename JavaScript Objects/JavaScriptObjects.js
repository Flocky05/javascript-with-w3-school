/*
Objects are Variables
JavaScript variables can contain single values:
*/
let person = "John Doe";

/*
Using an Object Literal
This is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Object.

Using an object literal, you both define and create an object in one statement.

An object literal is a list of name:value pairs (like age:50) inside curly braces {}.

The following example creates a new JavaScript object with four properties:
*/
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue",
};
// Spaces and line breaks are not important. An object definition can span multiple lines:
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue",
};
