// The "use strict" directive was new in ECMAScript version 5.

// It is not a statement, but a literal expression, ignored by earlier versions of JavaScript.

// With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.

"use strict";
x = 3.1416;
console.log(x);

// strict means you can't change the value easly so that if you use strict method
