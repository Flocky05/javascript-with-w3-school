// Block Scope
// Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope.

// ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.

// These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.

// Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:

// if any one use let and const inside of second brecate then use it
{
  let x = 2;
}
