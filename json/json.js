// structure of json

/* class ClassName {
    constructor() { ... }
} */

// why we use json in the code ?

/* The JSON format is syntactically similar to the code for creating JavaScript objects. Because of this, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into JavaScript objects. Since the format is text only, JSON data can easily be sent between computers, and used by any programming language. */
