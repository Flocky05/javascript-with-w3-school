/*
AJAX is a developer's dream, because you can:

Read data from a web server - after the page has loaded
Update a web page without reloading the page
Send data to a web server - in the background
*/

/*
What is AJAX?
AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.

AJAX is not a programming language.

AJAX just uses a combination of:

A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)
*/

/*
Modern Browsers (Fetch API)
Modern Browsers can use Fetch API instead of the XMLHttpRequest Object.

The Fetch API interface allows web browser to make HTTP requests to web servers.

If you use the XMLHttpRequest Object, Fetch can do the same in a simpler way.
